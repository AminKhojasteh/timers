# Working Hours Timer

### Simple App Built with React

This is a simple app I personally use to track my working hours throughout the week or month. When you start working, click "Start," and when you take a break, click "Stop." The timer records the total hours and minutes youâ€™ve worked, giving you a clear overview of your productive time. The app uses the browser's local storage to save your working hours for easy reference.
