### A simple, yet useful timer app for your workflow

This app is a timer that anyone can use. You can sign up and create personalized timers. The timers can track elapsed time for hundreds of hours, making them ideal for keeping track of the time you spend on specific tasks. With your email and password, you can synchronize your timers across different devices. You can also edit or delete your timers as needed.
This project features a frontend built with React and a backend powered by Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authorization, ensuring secure login. Once logged in, your session will stay active for an extended period, so you won't need to re-enter your credentials every time.
